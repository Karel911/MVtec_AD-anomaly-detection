Briefly, the task is to classify an extremely imbalanced images into 88 classes 
in which the label is composed of class-state pairs.  
To solve this problem, we used Efficientnet and Resnext as a backbone with different training methods (e.g. one-class self-supervised learning, arcFace loss, and  label smoothing).  
We also blended the model weights and prediction results based on the validation results and hypothesis.  
Please refer to [ensemble.py](https://github.com/Karel911/MVtec_AD-anomaly-detection/blob/main/ensemble.py) to see how we blended the model weights and prediction results.  


### Note that we were not able to reproduce our best private score (0.9270) perfectly, but got the close private score (0.9264).  


## Blending strategy
* Baseline1 (LB 0.896): EfficientNet-B6 (66) & EfficientNet-B6 (85, ugmentation including rotation of 45 degree)  
* soft_ensemble (LB 0.899): EfficientNet-B6 (66) & EfficientNet-B6 (85, rotate 45) & 
            EfficientNet-B6 (39, arcFace loss) & EfficientNet-B6 (92, arcFace & label smoothing loss  
* Baseline2 (LB 0.894): EfficientNet-B6 (146, label smoothing loss)
* One-class based self-supervised learning model: EfficientNet-B6 (87, excluding arcFace will be better)
* We drop the filp augmentations for some cases (e.g., metal_nut) on the one-class based SSL

### HARD ENSEMBLE WITH HYPOTHESIS 1

Observation 1-1: On the overall validation results, the anomaly class-combined was relatively hard to predict.  
Observation 1-2: Baseline1 has relatively better performance for the normal and anomaly-combined on the validation results.  

Hypothesis 1: Trust the results from the baseline1 and blend the new perspective from the soft_ensemble result 
              except for both normal and anomaly-combined.

Result: LB 0.902  
          
Priority 1: Trust a new perspective for a anomaly class except for the combined class.  
Priority 2: Trust normal class and anomaly class-combined from the baseline1.

-----------------
### HARD ENSEMBLE WITH HYPOTHESIS 2

Observation 2-1: The baseline2 showed better performance for the classes tile, carpet, and zipper on the validation 
                 compared to the baseline1.  
Observation 2-2: The baseline2 exhibited a different view for the anomaly class-combined on the validation
                 compared to the baseline1.  
              
Hypothesis 2-1: Trust the new perspective from the baseline2 results including the classes tile, carpet, and zipper.  
Hypothesis 2-2: Trust the new perspective for the anomaly class-combined from the baseline2 results.  

Result: LB 0.9099

Priority 1: Trust a new perspective for the anomaly class-combined (modified).  
Priority 2: Trust a new perspective for anomaly classes tile, carpet, and zipper from the baseline2.  
Priority 3: Trust normal and anomaly class-combined from the baseline1.

----------------

### HARD ENSEMBLE WITH HYPOTHESIS 3

Hypothesis 3: One-class based self supervised learning model has a different view compared with the baseline1 and 2.  

The combination of labels, 'cable', 'grid', 'metal_nut', 'pill', and 'wood', showed the best performance.  

Result: LB-Private 0.926

Priority 1: Trust a new perspective for the anomaly class-combined.  
Priority 2: Trust a new perspective for anomaly classes tile, carpet, and zipper from the baseline1.  
Priority 3: Trust a new perspective for anomaly classes cable, grid, metal_nut, pill, and wood 
            from the one-class based self supervised learning model.  
Priority 4: Trust normal class from the baseline1 (modified).

## Run
* To run the codes, use the following commands:<br>
<pre><code>
# EfficientNet-B6 with label smoothing
python main.py train --arch 6 --img_size 576 --criterion smoothing

# Different backbone model (example of ResNest)
python main.py train --model resnest --model_name resnest50d_4s2x40d
